# Session 0
introduce everyone involved in the course 
## Goals 
- learn to basics of programming in python, enable you to continue learning on your own
	- working with the terminal for installing packages 
	- syntax and programming concepts 
	- using jupyter notebooks 
- learn how to analyze and visualize data in python: 
	- basic data analysis with numpy, visualization with matplotlib 
	- handling data with pandas, visualization with seaborn 
- learn how to colloborate on programming projects 
	- version control with git
	- collaboration with GitHub 
- machine learning with python: scikit learn 
	- overview of machine learning algorithms 
	- data science pipeline: preprocessing, analyzing, training, interpreting
- half of the entire course time you will spend working on programming projects 
	- machine learning projects 
	- computational neuroscience projects 
	- own projects 

## Why python? 

## Style, philosophy, exam
- for every topic we will give some input and then help you working on tutorials 
- therefore: not much classroom teaching style, more hands on, interactive teaching style 
- main purpose of this course: get all of you to a good level in programming for the things to come in your master 
	- this is not about cafefully testing your skills in graded exercises and an exam, but about you learning how to learn programming
- when you take the course it should be about getting a good grade, but about learning things you will need during the master program 
- project presentation 
- still, there will be an short oral exam in the end, after the course, probably some time in december. 
- we will put most of the materials online: slides, links, tutorials

## Schedule
- 4 blocks, 3 days each 
	- Block 1: Oct 25 - 27
	- **Nov 2  - 3 no lecture**
	- Block 2: Nov 8 - 10
	- Block 3: Nov 15 - 17
	- Block 4: Nov 22 - 24
- first two blocks will consist of short lectures and long tutorials, more facetime 
	- thursday afternoon, friday 9-12 and 1-4, Saturday 9-12 (or shifted)
- last two blocks short lectures and project time, less facetime 
	- short lecture every day, afterwards project time, we are around for questions 
	
## Projects 
- Machine learning projects 
	- train a classifier to discrimate hand written digits, MNIST image data set https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database
		- compare classifiers, generate adverserial examples 
	- Neural network basics: implement a perceptron from scratch, implement your own MLP, backpropagation algorithm
	- Learn PyTorch: on MNIST, fashion clothes data set or object recognition data set 
	- Participate in a Kaggle competition: NYC taxi trip duration estimation, leaf classification 
- Computational neuroscience projects 
	- visual perception: monroe einstein illusion 
	- slow feature analysis,
