# Block 1

## Intro talk 
goal of the course, spirit, format, why python shortly, their backgrounds,
  projects, usefulness, oral exam. they are welcome to take all the time of the 
  course. but dont have to. we are offering, they can make use of it, if they want. 
  it is about learning, not about optimizing the grade. 

## Session 0: Introduction 
### Goals  
1. overview of course content, format, organisation stuff 
2. justification for using python
3. know who else is attending the course 
### Content 
- intro by Jakob
- overall goal of the course 
- why python? 
- course structure, lectures, projects, exam, style
  
## Session 1: Getting started
### Goals 
1) have python and anaconda installed 
2) navigate in the terminal, install packages, know different editors, run scripts 
3) work with jupyter notebook / lab, run simple arithmetic operations 

### Style
We do this session with our laptop on the beamer, doing stuff in the terminal in real time. We could have additional 
or a whiteboard with the essential commands: ls, pwd, mkdir etc. Or they take notes. 

### Content  
- install python (using Miniconda / Anaconda)
- intro to terminal/cmd commands 
    - open the terminal
    - navigate through directories, create, move delete
    - create files
- intro to python
  - use python in the terminal for simple arithmetics  
  - move to IPython, do arithmetics and define variables 
  - import math or time package and do more stuff 
  - pip/conda install a non standard package, e.g., 
  - create a file with .py extension and open it in a text editor (implement "Hello World!")
  - run the script in terminal 
- jupyter notebook
  - let them install jupyter
  - open a notebook and show them around, explain everything
  - do a more detailed tutorial, e.g., ?? those at jupyter.org are not useful
- bring everything of the above together into: jupyter lab

## Session 2: Basics of python
### Goals 
1) python syntax and types
2) functions, loops, if-else statements, list comprehension 
3) start coding

### Content  
- python basics, syntax, operations, types etc: 
    - https://github.com/nickdelgrosso/SciPyCourse2016/blob/master/Python%20Course%20Lecture%201.ipynb
    - https://github.com/nickdelgrosso/SciPyCourse2016/blob/master/Python%20Course%20Lecture%202.ipynb
- at the end they should know: booleans, lists, dics, tuples, loops, conditional statements etc.

### Hands on 
- https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python for complete beginners
- http://www.codewars.com/kata/pillars/train/python for practice 
- http://www.codewars.com/kata/sum-of-positive/train/python


## Session 3: Analysis and Plotting, Numpy and Matplotlib
### Goals 
1. concept of numpy
2. load data, analyse data with numpy 
3. plotting data with matplotlib 

### Content   
- in depth numpy lecture
    - https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/02.00-Introduction-to-NumPy.ipynb
- in depth matplotlib lecture 
    - https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/04.00-Introduction-To-Matplotlib.ipynb
- more condensed numpy and matplotlib lecture: 
    - https://github.com/nickdelgrosso/SciPyCourse2016/blob/master/Python%20Course%20Lecture%203.ipynb
- provide an exercise with loading data, using numpy for analysis and plt for plotting
    - find good tuturial  

### Homework:
- homeworks by nickdelgrosso: 
    - https://github.com/nickdelgrosso/SciPyCourse2016/blob/master/Homework%201%20Jupyter%20Notebook%20and%20Builtin%20Type%20Methods.ipynb

# Block 2

## Session 1, pandas
- https://github.com/jahma/Assignments/tree/master/A2
- https://github.com/jahma/Assignments/tree/master/A3

## Session 2, seaborn

## Session 3, scikit learn

## Pandas and seaborn
- Alvaro? What to cover?
- load data, merge, group by, apply
- how long will it take? morning session and first afternoon session?  

## intro to machine learning
- http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html#machine-learning-the-problem-setting
- linear regression / perceptron, logistic regression
- over fitting, training data, test data, cross validation, hyper parameters, bias variance trade-off
    - material:
- SVM, NNs, random forest  
- PCA, clustering

## Hands on
- simple classification with perceptron: code xor problem
- intro sk learn
    - simple NN or SVM for sklearn example data set
    - sklearn example


## Homework
- coding exercise from sklearn, kaggle, MI or MHBF
    - apple and oranges perceptron exercise from MI 1
    - more advanced: MI 1 SVM exercise
- maybe this covers it all:
    - http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/statistical_inference/index.html#stat-learn-tut-index
- or kaggle:
    - https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer

block 3 and 4 project time
if they want pytorch, sure.

presentation for day 1: idea of the course, Jakob part of it,

propose own projects
mnist with 4 classifiers
adverserial examples on mnist
kaggle competitons
short talks on friday and sat in the morning to make sure they come in.
also for blocks 3 and 4.

ask at the LRZ course how to get students use online computing resources
make a tutorial for the students if possible.

have scalable projects

have project descriptions

git on the beginning of block 3.

for next year: gitlab has it TUMID access? make group in TUM IT, give access to them

for presentations, add little quizes with a good tool.

private and share version of the repo.

separate repo in cne for the projects for them to work on: create forks and do pull requests etc.

# Block 3
## Guided kaggle competition
Guide them how to preprocess, explore the data, point them tutorials, online advice
- https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration
- https://www.kaggle.com/c/leaf-classification  

## More tools:
- conda environments,
- debugging,
- (profiling),
- editors: sublime, atom, pycharm

## Git

## Pytorch
nope

## Online computing resources
- https://www.crestle.com/
- https://www.paperspace.com/
- https://aws.amazon.com/de/
- LRZ
-

## online courses

## mini projects ideas

# Block 4

## Projects

# General ideas

- ask for feedback after every day
  - pace
  - content
  - style, clarity

- we give an overview in the beginning,
- we summarize what they learned in the end of the day.
- Piazza or Slack for discussion?
