# Block 1
- in general dont set the outline like this, bottom up, rather find a good course and use their outline, adapt it, top down.
- write down 2-3 things to be learned in each session

## Intro talk 
goal of the course, spirit, format, why python shortly, their backgrounds,
  projects, usefulness, oral exam. they are welcome to take all the time of the 
  course. but dont have to. we are offering, they can make use of it, if they want. 
  it is about learning, not about optimizing the grade. 
  
## Session 1: Getting started
### Goals 
1) have python and anaconda installed 
2) navigate in the terminal, install packages, use an editor for coding 
3) know about jupyter notebook and how to open it

### Content  
- install python and anaconda
  - intro to python in general: what is python, what is anaconda,
    what are packages? 
  - show how to install a package
  - short note on environments
  - what is conda, pip, how does it work on windows, macos, linux?
  - allocate time to make sure everyone has python installed etc.
- intro to terminal and text editors for coding
  - packages, pip
  - cmd basic, vi editor, how to edit and how to exit
  - mention atom, pycharm
  - hands on
    - create folders, create and edit python file, hello world
    - create environment, install package, open jupyter, import package
- jupyter notebook
  - let them install jupyter
  - open a notebook and show them around, explain everything. point to the first tutorial on http://jupyter.org/    
  - let them do a basic jupyter notebook / ipython tutorial in the notebook.   
  - mention how it works in the background but explain only later (mini lecture)
- bring everything of the above together into: jupyter lab

## Session 2: Basic python
### Goals 
1) python syntax and types  
2) loops, if-else statements, list comprehension, slicing 
3) start coding
### Content  
- python basics, syntax, operations, types etc: 
    - https://github.com/nickdelgrosso/SciPyCourse2016/blob/master/Python%20Course%20Lecture%201.ipynb
    - https://github.com/nickdelgrosso/SciPyCourse2016/blob/master/Python%20Course%20Lecture%202.ipynb
- at the end they should know: booleans, lists, dics, tuples, loops, conditional statements etc.
- this is the basis for numpy and matplotlib

### Hands on

## Session 3: Analysis and Plotting
### Goals 
1. concept of numpy
2. load data, analyse data with numpy 
3. plotting data with matplotlib 

### Content   
- numpy and matplotlib lecture: 
    - https://github.com/nickdelgrosso/SciPyCourse2016/blob/master/Python%20Course%20Lecture%203.ipynb
- provide an exercise with loading data, using numpy for analysis and plt for plotting 

### Homework:
- homeworks by nickdelgrosso: 
    - https://github.com/nickdelgrosso/SciPyCourse2016/blob/master/Homework%201%20Jupyter%20Notebook%20and%20Builtin%20Type%20Methods.ipynb 
- katas, python challenge, links to tutorials

# Block 2

## Session 1, pandas
- https://github.com/jahma/Assignments/tree/master/A2
- https://github.com/jahma/Assignments/tree/master/A3

## Session 2, seaborn

## Session 3, scikit learn

## Pandas and seaborn
- Alvaro? What to cover?
- load data, merge, group by, apply
- how long will it take? morning session and first afternoon session?  

## intro to machine learning
- http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html#machine-learning-the-problem-setting
- linear regression / perceptron, logistic regression
- over fitting, training data, test data, cross validation, hyper parameters, bias variance trade-off
    - material:
- SVM, NNs, random forest  
- PCA, clustering

## Hands on
- simple classification with perceptron: code xor problem
- intro sk learn
    - simple NN or SVM for sklearn example data set
    - sklearn example


## Homework
- coding exercise from sklearn, kaggle, MI or MHBF
    - apple and oranges perceptron exercise from MI 1
    - more advanced: MI 1 SVM exercise
- maybe this covers it all:
    - http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/statistical_inference/index.html#stat-learn-tut-index
- or kaggle:
    - https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer

block 3 and 4 project time
if they want pytorch, sure.

presentation for day 1: idea of the course, Jakob part of it,

propose own projects
mnist with 4 classifiers
adverserial examples on mnist
kaggle competitons
short talks on friday and sat in the morning to make sure they come in.
also for blocks 3 and 4.

ask at the LRZ course how to get students use online computing resources
make a tutorial for the students if possible.

have scalable projects

have project descriptions

git on the beginning of block 3.

for next year: gitlab has it TUMID access? make group in TUM IT, give access to them

for presentations, add little quizes with a good tool.

private and share version of the repo.

separate repo in cne for the projects for them to work on: create forks and do pull requests etc.

# Block 3
## Guided kaggle competition
Guide them how to preprocess, explore the data, point them tutorials, online advice
- https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration
- https://www.kaggle.com/c/leaf-classification  

## More tools:
- conda environments,
- debugging,
- (profiling),
- editors: sublime, atom, pycharm

## Git

## Pytorch
nope

## Online computing resources
- https://www.crestle.com/
- https://www.paperspace.com/
- https://aws.amazon.com/de/
- LRZ
-

## online courses

## mini projects ideas

# Block 4

## Projects

# General ideas

- ask for feedback after every day
  - pace
  - content
  - style, clarity

- we give an overview in the beginning,
- we summarize what they learned in the end of the day.
- Piazza or Slack for discussion?
