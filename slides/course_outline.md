# Block 1

## Session 1
- install python and anaconda, environments, packages
  - intro to python in general: what is python, what is anaconda,
    what are packages? environments?
    what is conda, pip, how does it work on windows, macos, linux?
- intro to terminal and text editors for coding
  - cmd basic, vi editor, atom, pycharm
  - hands on
- intro to ipython and jupyter notebook / lab
  - hands on

### Hands on
- create folders, create and edit python file, hello world
- create environment, install package, open jupyter, import package
- installing jupyter, tutorials provided by http://jupyter.org/


## Session 2
- python basics, syntax, operations, types etc.
- give only a rough overview, use other courses for detailed tutorials to work
- at the end they should know: booleans, lists, dics, tuples, loops, conditional statements etc. 
- this is the basis for numpy and matplotlib 

### Hands on
- small python exercise with pair programming, maybe a short kata? 
- exercises from other intro courses

## Session 3
- numpy, matplotlib (introduce that ealier?)
- scipy
- hands on: more advanced calculations and plotting
- homework: katas, python challenge, links to tutorials 

# Block 2

## Pandas and seaborn 
- Alvaro? What to cover? 
- load data, merge, group by, apply
- how long will it take? morning session and first afternoon session?  

## intro to machine learning
- http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html#machine-learning-the-problem-setting
- linear regression / perceptron, logistic regression
- over fitting, training data, test data, cross validation, hyper parameters, bias variance trade-off
    - material:
- SVM, NNs, random forest  
- PCA, clustering 

## Hands on 
- simple classification with perceptron: code xor problem
- intro sk learn 
    - simple NN or SVM for sklearn example data set
    - sklearn example
    

## Homework 
- coding exercise from sklearn, kaggle, MI or MHBF
    - apple and oranges perceptron exercise from MI 1
    - more advanced: MI 1 SVM exercise
- maybe this covers it all: 
    - http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/statistical_inference/index.html#stat-learn-tut-index
- or kaggle: 
    - https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer
    
    
# Block 3 
## Guided kaggle competition
Guide them how to preprocess, explore the data, point them tutorials, online advice
- https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration
- https://www.kaggle.com/c/leaf-classification  

## More tools: 
- conda environments, 
- debugging, 
- (profiling), 
- editors: sublime, atom, pycharm

## Git 

## Pytorch

# General ideas

- ask for feedback after every day
  - pace
  - content
  - style, clarity
  
- we give an overview in the beginning, 
- we summarize what they learned in the end of the day. 
- Piazza or Slack for discussion?
